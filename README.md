Multi-Coin Miner

This is a Python script that can be used to mine multiple coins at different pools. The script automatically switches between different coins and pools at specified intervals.

Features:

Supports mining multiple coins at different pools
Automatically switches between different coins and pools at specified intervals
Written in Python, a widely-used and easy-to-learn programming language

Requirements:
Python 3 installed on your system
A mining program and credentials for each pool and coin you want to mine
Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the script multi-coin-miner.py in a text editor.
Configure the list of pools and coins to be mined in the pools_and_coins list.
Replace the miner_command in the subprocess.run() function with the actual command to start your mining program.
Replace username and password with your credentials for each pool.
Save and close the script.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script using the following command: python3 multi-coin-miner.py
The script will start mining the first coin at the first pool, and will automatically switch between different coins and pools as specified in the pools_and_coins list.

Troubleshooting:

If the script does not work as expected, please check the following:

Make sure that you have installed Python 3 and your mining program on your system.
Make sure that the paths to your mining program and your credentials are correct in the script.
Make sure that the pools_and_coins list is properly configured with the correct pools and coins to be mined.
